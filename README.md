# A quick introduction to astropy units/constants

I have written a Jupyter notebook with a short introduction to the python modules astropy.units and astropy.constants.  In order to run the notebook you must have python and jupyter notebook installed on your computer.  

[Installation instructions for miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) 

[Installation instrcutions for jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install)

All of the additional python packages needed to run the notebook are listed in requirements.txt.  For quick installation with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), open your terminal and type

pip install -r requirements.txt

After this you should be good to go, open the jupyter notebook and get started!
